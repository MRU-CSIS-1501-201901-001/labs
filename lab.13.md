# Lab-13

## Goals for this lab

Introduce you to the super-secret make command. It might be convenient when working on the assignment and the tests.

Working on your drills, practicing for Friday's quiz, and/or moving forward on your assignment? Also good uses of this time.

### MAKE

If you run the command `make` from any of the assignment or quiz folders - it has to be in the same directory as the Makefile - all your Java files will be compiled properly. (This is pretty useful on the current and last assignment, when there are some complicated compile commands that need to be issued.)

Also, if you use `make run`, it will compile and run your Main, which is pretty darn useful.
