# Lab-04

## Goals for this lab

I'm going to admit it - I dropped the ball in explaining tracing in lecture this week. I'm going to rectify that in this lab: I'll do a trace, we'll do a trace together, and then you can do a trace with some of your peers on your own.

## TASKS

We'll be using the [Hand Tracing Practice](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-1501-201901-001/labs/blob/master/docs/lab.04.tracing.handout.md) handout for the following.

I'll go through the first one on the board.

The second one, we'll do together.

I'll have you work in teams and hit the whiteboard for the final one.

You can use REPL.IT to check your work ... for this and any other tracing practice you come across!
