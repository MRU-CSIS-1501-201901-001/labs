# Lab-03

## Goals for this lab

- If you did not complete lab quiz 00, this is your final chance to do so. Instructions are here: https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-1501-201901-001/lab.quizzes/blob/master/00/lab.quiz.00.md. You have until the end of the lab to complete it, though you should **very** much try to get it done within 25 minutes.
- If you thought you completed the quiz last Friday, but didn't receive a checkmark for it on Blackboard, you should talk to me before the lab is over.
- If you've already gotten a mark for lab quiz 0, or complete it today, I will recommend that you get your week 1 drills done, since I'm kicking around and (overly) eager to answer your questions.
  - If you are done the week 1 drills...the week 2 drills are available!
